# About

ColorShift is a Python-based arcade game where the player controls a red cube on a colorful floor, aiming to avoid collisions with obstacles and reach as far as possible.

# Features

ColorShift is an exciting arcade game that involves navigating a red cube through a vibrant, obstacle-filled environment. To create a similar game using Python, you can use the Arcade library, which is a modern Python framework designed for crafting games with compelling graphics and sound. The library is object-oriented, supports Python 3.6 and above, and provides a robust set of tools for game development.

# Rating

The Ursina library for game development. However, there are areas for improvement, such as code organization, variable naming, magic numbers, comments, error handling, global variables, and unused code.
The code lacks proper organization, with functions like `update()` and `input()` defined inside other functions, making it harder to read and maintain. Variable names are unclear or inconsistent, and reusing variable names without resetting them can lead to unexpected behavior. Magic numbers should be defined as constants with meaningful names to improve readability and maintainability.
Comments are not fully explaining the logic behind certain code blocks, and error handling mechanisms should be implemented to make the code more robust. Encapsulating related variables and functions into classes can improve modularity and reduce global state. Unused code, such as the `floor` variable in the `update()` function, should be removed to improve code clarity and reduce complexity.
By addressing these points, the code can be enhanced in readability, maintainability, and robustness.
